## Installation:

1. Copy the [`TSV`](TSV/) folder to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages`.
2. Copy the [`TSV.sublime-settings`](User/TSV.sublime-settings) file to `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User`

Alternatively, if you are in the same directory as this `README.md` file, the following shell command should do the trick:

    cp -R TSV User ~/"Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/"
